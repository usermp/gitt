# gitt - A CLI for Better Commit Messages with AI Support

`gitt` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps you write better commit messages by providing a structured workflow, integrating AI for message generation, and offering a user-friendly interactive experience.

## Features

* Interactive file selection with `fzf`
* Choose commit types from a predefined list
* Automatically format commit messages based on selected type
* Generate commit messages using **Cloudflare AI**
* Edit AI-generated messages before finalizing
* Confirm commit before execution
* Optional GUI support (via Streamlit, coming soon)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) ‚Äì required for AI message generation
* [curl](https://curl.se/) ‚Äì used to call Cloudflare AI APIs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitt.git
   cd gitt
   ```

2. Install the CLI globally:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

   This will copy the `gitt` script to `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Configuration

To enable AI commit message generation via [Cloudflare AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), you must configure your API credentials:

```bash
gitt --config-api
```

You will be prompted to enter your:

* `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
* `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

These will be stored securely in `~/.config/gitt/.env`.

## Usage

### CLI Mode

Run the following command in a Git repository:

```bash
gitt
```

Workflow:

1. Select files to stage (or `[ALL]`).
2. Choose a commit type.
3. Choose whether to use AI to generate the commit message.
4. If AI is used:

   * AI suggests a short message.
   * You can **edit** the suggestion or accept it as-is.
5. Review the final commit message.
6. Confirm to execute the commit.

### GUI Mode (coming soon)

```bash
gitt --gui
```
